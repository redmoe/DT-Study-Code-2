# Week 2: Introduction to Classes and Objects

## What is a class? 
- A class is a way to represent a type of idea, made up of data and functions
- The data is stored in variables
- The functions are action that when preformed can use that data

## What is an object?
- An object is an instance (individual example) of a class
- For example, your phone has the class of Phone. We may have the same type of phone and they may be able to preform the same functions like texting, browsing the web, etc. but our phones don't share the same libary of photos or contacts

### What is this for?
- To have unique examples of similarly functional things
- Making programs that use actions and data to operate rather than pre-planned logic
- For object oriented programing!
 
### Why and when would you use it?
- When your code starts to have a lot of variables and functions that need to have the ability to be changed
- When you have a bunch of variables that are interconnected with each other i.e playerX, playerY, playerName

### What is the syntax?
- class MyClassName{} //most basic class you can get without an error
- MyClassName myObjectName = new MyClassName(); //Creates a new object instance of MyClassName

### Notes
- Common practice is to capitalize class names so as not to be confused with variables and functions

### Live Code
- We will be making a traffic generator using Objects and Classes
- Download introExampleCarsStartingCode
- It is a code example which does not use Objects and can only show 1 car moving across the screen

## Schedule for Week 2

### Introduction to Functions
- What is this?  A function is a basic building block for sketches. A tool with a specific purpose, one that can be called upon whenever that purpose is needed. A named section of a program that performs a specific task.
- What is this for? Code organization, thought organization, logic - The power of functions is modularity.
- Why and when would you use it? When you have a piece of code that you'd like to run mutliple times but don't want to keep track of the long lines of code it creates. Once a function is defined, the code inside the function need not be repeated again. All you would need to do in that situation is write one line that calls the function.
- What is the syntax?
void myFunction() {

}
Notes
Processing runs a program one line at a time. When a function is run, it jumps to where the function is defined and runs the code there, then jumps back to where it left off. The name does not matter; it's up to you. It should have something to do with what it does. For instance, built-in functions rect() draws a rectangle, ellipse() draws an ellipse, and random() gives you a random value.

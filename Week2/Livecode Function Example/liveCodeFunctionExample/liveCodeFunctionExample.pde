background(0);//this is a processing function

rect(0,0,100,100);//this is also a function

//flower(5,5,20); this is not a defined function by processing

void setup() {//guess what? this is also a function
}
//some are special functions like setup and draw which have unique properties like when the activate
//void is a return type, when something has nothing to return


//having arguments allow to use functions with diffrent parameters
//return type name (argument,argument) {what the function does}

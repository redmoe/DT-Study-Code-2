# Week 4: Introduction to Motion

## What is motion? 
- like a flip book
- animation is created by drawing an image, then drawing a slightly different image (with perhaps one or two pixel difference), then another, and so on

### What is this for?
- illusion of persistence of vision
- when a set of similar images is presented at a fast enough rate, our brains translate these images into motion
 
### Why and when would you use it?
- animation
- any project that has moving parts in draw()

### How do you express that in code?
- any variable that you update the value of in draw() has the potential to move
- for instance, if you make an x and/or y value of a rect() and then add one to those values in draw(), it'll appear to move
